Y Combinator Funding Application
Summer 2011

Application deadline: 8 pm PST on March 20, 2011.

Please try to answer each question in less than 120 words.

We look at online demos only for the most promising applications, so don't skimp on the application because you're relying on a good demo.

Though we don't make any formal promise about secrecy, we will try to avoid disclosing your plans to potential competitors.

If you're about to answer a question by saying you can't tell us because the answer is classified or controversial, please tell us instead about an instance that isn't.

We recommend you save regularly by clicking on the update button at the bottom of this page. Otherwise you may lose work if we restart the server.

Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that each founder has built or achieved.
Diamond Magazine - Playboy for Ivy League schools

Please tell us about the time you, mattdipasquale, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.
At my friend's house party, everyone was telling me about his HOT, blonde cousin who was coming soon. When she arrived, everyone surrounded her with attention. I ignored her the whole night. When she eventually talked to me, I got up soon after. When she asked to read the Maxim I was reading, I said, "No. It's a men's magazine." When she grabbed & held my hand to keep me from waking up my friend, I said, "No hand-holding." By the end of the night, she was so sexually frustrated, she forced herself in bed with me. Unfortunately, she soon found out it was just an act (hack) and lost interest, but not before I managed to lose my virginity. Score!

Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.
Lovers on Facebook - http://j.mp/mylovers
♥ share love with friends
♥ send friends gifts
♥ add friends as lovers

Reached over 1 million monthly active users.
Over 175,000 likes.

How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?

Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?
I built Lovers on Facebook and the users are always posting to meet others. "Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman!" - Napoleon Hill

What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?
It empowers you to meet people nearby with similar interests. Facebook is great to keep in touch with friends but not for meeting people. Meetup is great for groups but not for one-to-one get togethers. Craigslist is great but old & sketchy now. Grindr is sweet but only for gays. The others (like Loopt Mix, Scout, MeetMoi) are too much like dating apps, and I don't want to be seen on those.

Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?
Grindr (best), Loopt Mix, Scout, Facebook (followers). I don't really fear any of these "competitors." They'll all have to change their focus to be like Acani, and when Facebook introduced Places, it only helped/validated foursquare. Loopt Mix has a similar slogan, but it sorts by m4w, w4m, etc., like a dating app.

What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?
It cannot look ANYTHING like a dating app. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. They are not dating apps, but tons of dating & flirting happens on Facebook.

How do or will you make money? How much could you make? (We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
Manual messaging will be free, but you could pay $10 to automatically blast a message to 100 closest skateboarders. This allows for fast & simple "advertising" for individuals as well as companies.

If you've already started working on it, how long have you been working and how many lines of code (if applicable) have you written?
1 year 1 month; ~43,000 lines

How far along are you? Do you have a beta yet? If not, when will you? Are you launched? If so, how many users do you have? Do you have revenue? If so, how much? If you're launched, what is your monthly growth rate (in users or revenue or both)?
I'm about 75% done with the beta.

If you have an online demo, what's the url? (Please don't password protect it; just use an obscure url.)
http://www.acani.com/videos/acani-demo-2011-03-20.mov

How will you get users? If your idea is the type that faces a chicken-and-egg problem in the sense that it won't be attractive to users till it has a lot of users (e.g. a marketplace, a dating site, an ad network), how will you overcome that?
Exclusivity. It's about quality, not quantity. At first, I'll only open it up to intelligent programmers: those with GitHub accounts, certain Facebook criteria, and/or enough correct answers on a timed quiz.

And models and pretty girls can join too, of course.

I can also advertise on my Lovers Facebook app, which gets thousands of hits/day.

If you're already incorporated, when were you? Who are the shareholders and what percent does each own? If you've had funding, how much, at what valuation(s)?
I incorporated Acani, Inc. in Delaware, January 2011. There are no shareholders yet.

If you're not incorporated yet, please list the percent of the company you plan to give each founder, and anyone else you plan to give stock to. (This question is as much for you as us.)
mattdipasquale - 100%

If we fund you, which of the founders will commit to working exclusively (no school, no other jobs) on this project for the next year?
mattdipasquale

For founders who can't, why not? What level of commitment are they willing to make?

Do any founders have other commitments between June and August 2011 inclusive?
No.

Do any founders have commitments in the future (e.g. finishing college, going to grad school), and if so what?
No.

Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?
Westport, CT now, Palo Alto, CA after

Are any of the founders covered by noncompetes or intellectual property agreements that overlap with your project? Will any be working as employees or consultants for anyone else?
No.

Was any of your code written by someone who is not one of your founders? If so, how can you safely use it? (Open source is ok of course.)
Yes. I hired 2 programmers and paid them. I have contracts they signed. I've rewritten most of their code. I worked with a friend from Harvard on the chat server. He helped for free. I can rewrite that if I have to. It's only about 100 lines. We worked together on it for 2-3 weekends.

Are any of the following true? (a) You are the only founder. (b) You are a student who may return to school when the next term starts. (c) Half or more of your group can't move to the Bay Area. (d) One or more founders will keep their current jobs. (e) None of the founders are programmers.

(Answering yes doesn't disqualify you. It's just to remind us to check.)
yes

If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for. Often when we fund people it's to do something they list here and not in the main application.
Diamond Magazine - http://www.diamond-mag.com

Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered. (The answer need not be related to your project.)
Heart disease, which kills millions of Americans each year, can be easily prevented & even reversed. http://www.heartattackproof.com
