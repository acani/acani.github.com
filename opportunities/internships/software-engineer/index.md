Learn from a pro, gain valuable experience, and have fun developing a cool iPhone app.


## Plan

I'll guide you in developing Acani. I may have you [pair program](http://j.mp/cuq3vn) with another intern. I'll review your code. We'll plan out and reflect on the development of the app together a couple times per month. I'll be available by email for guidance & assistance.


## App Concept

Acani is like [Grindr](http://grindr.com/) but for everyone: hikers, yogis, skateboarders, nutritarians, programmers, models & photographers, moviegoers, etc. The mission is to connect people nearby with similar interests.


## Logistics

Term: Summer 2013 (or start now and continue on)

Hours: An average of at least 8 hours/week

Monetary Consideration: None

Experience & Guidance: Priceless

Location: I work from [Kripalu][1] in Stockbridge, MA. You're welcome to visit me here or work remotely.


## Criteria

I'm seeking *Amazing*, intelligent, genius, passionate, diligent individuals who meet the following criteria:

- **Purpose**: Passionate about developing applications that revolutionize society
- **Autonomy**: Enjoy having freedom & responsibility to do their best work
- **Mastery**: Love learning, pair programming, and creating amazing products

I'm specifically looking for someone who wants to master iOS (Objective-C) development and who's also interested in cutting-edge mobile (Android, Windows Mobile, etc.) & web development. No experience is necessary. I'm just looking for Amazing individuals because "DESIRE BACKED BY FAITH knows no such word as impossible."

Just make sure you have a new [Mac][2] running the latest version of [OS X][3] and the latest version of [Xcode][4].


## Apply

Please apply via the [Acani Internship Application Form][5].
