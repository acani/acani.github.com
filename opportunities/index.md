Hours: An average of at least 8 hours/week

Monetary Consideration: None

Experience & Guidance: Priceless

Location: Remote. I'll be at Kripalu in Stockbridge, MA. You're welcome to visit me here.


### Criteria

### FAQ

* I don't know the first thing about programming or iOS development. Can I still apply?

    Yes! I know they don't teach iOS development in high school or college (Or, maybe they do now?). I'm looking for those with a strong desire to (and faith & confidence in themselves that they can) learn how to build iOS apps, those who find this project interesting and love to learn new things, especially outside of the classroom.
  
* How could I get started learning iOS development?

    The best way is to start with an idea for an iPhone app (How about Acani?) and to build it! Hands on experience and learning as you go are golden!
  
    Check out my blog post [How to Build an iPhone App][9].

    Once you have an idea for an app that you'd like to make, [Download Xcode][2]. It's [$4.99 on the Mac App Store][6] or free if you're a member of the [iOS or Mac Developer Program][7] (each $99/year).

    After installing Xcode, open it and type `Option + Command + ?` and then type the class, object, or method you want to know more about and hit enter. You'll find great reference documentation and related tutorials and sample code & projects.

    Also, for other great keyboard shortcuts, check out this [Complete Xcode Keyboard Shortcut List][3] & the [StackOverflow question: What is your favorite Xcode keyboard shortcut?][4]. Note: A bunch of the Xcode 3 keyboard shortcuts have changed in Xcode 4. [StackOverflow][8] is the best place to ask programming questions if you can't find your answer through Google. Your question will be answered by expert iOS engineers within seconds of asking it. It's literally amazing!

    I recommend reading the books *iPhone Developer's Cookbook*, *iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide*, and *Cocoa Design Patterns*. Did you know you can find PDFs of most books for free from [library.nu][5]?

    I also recommend attending iPhone conferences like WWDC. I went to the Voices That Matter iPhone Developer's Conference in Seattle, WA, April 8-10, 2011. It was sweet! :)

Best!
