# acani iOS Opportunity & Summer Internship


## Opportunity

Gain valuable experience [pair programming](http://j.mp/cuq3vn) with other iOS engineers on a really *SWEET* project... all while having fun and getting paid.

## Team

Two iOS engineers, of which you will be one, who will partner on building the app and pair most of the time.

One team leader, me, who will guide the direction of the app and work & program together with the two iOS engineers.

We'll plan out and reflect on the development of the app together on the weekends. I will also provide programming assistance to you then. You will then pair together on the weekdays to carry out our plan. I will always available via phone or email.

## Commitment

Start immediately, part-time (10-20 hrs/wk) on nights & primarily weekends, and continue on to a full-time (40 hrs/wk) summer internship.

## acani

[acani](/) empowers you to meet people nearby with similar interests. It's like [Grindr](http://www.grindr.com) for everyone: skateboarders, programmers, models & photographers, etc. Watch an [acani demo video](/videos/acani-demo-2011-03-20.mov) of what we've developed so far.

## Team Leader

I, [Matt Di Pasquale](http://www.mattdipasquale.com), graduated from Harvard, class of 2008, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I have over seven years of experience in computer programming, over four years of experience as a web developer, and over one year of experience as a iOS engineer. I recently developed the [Lovers Facebook application](http://j.mp/mylovers), which reached over 1 million monthly active users. I have a passion for building social applications that revolutionize the productivity & effectiveness of the world by causing people to work together to be healthy, wealthy, loving, and abundant!

## Motivation

I believe we can make the best, most cutting-edge platform for meeting people nearby with similar interests.

- Facebook is great for keeping in touch with friends, but it's not for meeting new people.
- Meetup is cool for groups, but it's not for one-to-one get togethers.
- Craigslist works for finding apartments & strippers, but it's old-school & sketchy.
- Grindr is really cool for gay guys, but what about everyone else?

## Technologies

</dl>

## Features

Here are a few pending features we'll be implementing together:

- user registers through Facebook Connect
- user uploads her profile picture
- get & update iPhone's location asynchronously in the background

## Goal

To complete version 1 of the app and submit it to the App Store by the end of the summer (Thursday, September 1, 2011). Version 1 will include the least amount of features possible that constitutes a workable & presentable private beta. Trust me, it's a lot more work than it sounds, but I think we can do it!

## Criteria

I'm seeking two amazing, genius, diligent individuals who meet the following criteria:

- Passionate about developing an application that revolutionizes society.
- Able & willing to work 10-20 hrs/wk together in person on nights & primarily weekends.
- Loves pair programming, BDD, design patterns, and writing clean, simple, and well-commented code.

## Logistics

I'm available nights (6:30pm onward) & weekends (10am - 6pm), during which I can meet in Manhattan or near Westport, CIdeally, all three of us would work together 6 hours on Saturday & 6 hours on Sunday for a total of 12 hours. Then, during the summer internship, you could work the rest of your hours during the week with your partner.

## Compensation

The compensation will be competitive and will be based on experience, hard work, and results.

## Beyond Compensation

By the end of the summer, you'll be a much more experienced iOS engineer, prepared to build an app of your own or to take on an exciting position at acani or at any other company seeking iOS engineers, such as [Venmo][1].

You'll be able to claim to your friends, on your resume, and in interviews that you have at least one substantial app in the App Store.

Also, include your resume (or LinkedIn) and links to your websites, projects, and GitHub & StackOverflow profiles if you have them.

## FAQ

* I don't know the first thing about iOS development. Can I still apply?

  Yes! I know they don't teach iOS development in college (Or, maybe they do now?). I'm looking for those who love to learn new things, especially outside of the classroom.
  
* How could I get started learning iOS development?

  The best way is to start with an idea for an iPhone app (How about acani?) and to build it! Hands on experience and learning as you go is golden!

  Once you have an idea for an app that you'd like to make, [Download Xcode][2]. It's free if you register as an Apple Developer.
  
  After installing Xcode, open it and type `Option + Command + ?` and then type the class, object, or method you want to know more about. You'll find great reference documentation and related tutorials and sample code & projects.
  
  Also, for other great keyboard shortcuts, check out this [Complete Xcode Keyboard Shortcut List][3] & the [StackOverflow question: What is your favorite Xcode keyboard shortcut?][4]. StackOverflow is the best place to ask programming questions if you can't find your answer through Google. Your question will be answered by expert iOS engineers within seconds of asking it. It's literally amazing!

  I recommend reading the books *iPhone Developer's Cookbook*, *iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide*, and *Cocoa Design Patterns*. Did you know you can find PDFs of most books for free from [library.nu][5]?
  
  I also recommend attending iPhone conferences like WWDC. I'm going to the Voices That Matter iPhone Developer's Conference in Seattle, WA, April 8-10, 2011.

Thanks!
