# acani iOS Opportunity & Summer Internship


## Opportunity

Gain valuable experience [pair programming](http://j.mp/cuq3vn) with other iOS engineers on a really *SWEET* project... all while having fun and getting paid.

## Team

Two iOS engineers, of which you will be one, who will partner on building the app and pair most of the time.

One team leader, me, who will guide the direction of the app and work & program together with the two iOS engineers.

## Commitment

Start immediately, part-time (10+ hrs/wk) on nights & weekends, and continue on to a full-time (40 hrs/wk) summer internship.

## acani

[acani](/) empowers you to meet people nearby with similar interests. It's like [Grindr](http://www.grindr.com) for everyone: skateboarders, programmers, models & photographers, etc. Watch an [acani demo video](/videos/acani-demo-2011-03-20.mov) of what we've developed so far.

## Team Leader

I, [Matt Di Pasquale](http://www.mattdipasquale.com), graduated from Harvard, class of 2008, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I have over seven years of experience in computer programming, over four years of experience as a web developer, and over one year of experience as a iOS engineer. I recently developed the [Lovers Facebook application](http://j.mp/mylovers), which reached over 1 million monthly active users. I have a passion for building social applications that revolutionize the productivity & effectiveness of the world by causing people to work together to be healthy, wealthy, loving, and abundant!

## Motivation

I believe we can make the best, most cutting-edge application for meeting people nearby with similar interests.

- Facebook is great for keeping in touch with friends, but it's not for meeting new people.
- Meetup is cool for groups, but it's not for one-to-one get togethers.
- Craigslist works for finding apartments & strippers, but it's old-school & sketchy.
- Grindr is really cool for gay guys, but what about everyone else?

## Features

Here are a few pending features we'll be implementing together:

- user uploads her profile picture
- get & update iPhone's location asynchronously in the background

## Goal

The goalo complete version 1 of the app and submit it to the App Store by the end of the summer (Thursday, September 1, 2011). Version 1 will include the least amount of features possible that constitute a workable & presentable private beta.

## Criteria

I'm seeking amazing, genius, diligent individuals who meet the following criteria:

- Passionate about developing an application that revolutionizes society.
- Able & willing to work 10+ hrs/wk together in person on nights & weekends.
- Loves pair programming, BDD, design patterns, and writing clean, simple, and well-commented code.

## Logistics

I'm available nights (6:30pm onward) & weekends (10am - 6pm), during which I can meet in Manhattan or near Westport, CIdeally, all three of us would work together 6 hours on Saturday & 6 hours on Sunday for a total of 12 hours. Then, during the summer internship, you could work the rest of your hours during the week with your partner.
