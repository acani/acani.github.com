# iOS Opportunity

## Opportunity

Gain valuable experience [pair programming](http://j.mp/cuq3vn) with an iOS engineer on a really *SWEET* project... all while having fun and getting paid.

## acani

[acani](/) empowers you to meet people nearby with similar interests. It's like [Grindr](http://www.grindr.com) for everyone: skateboarders, programmers, models & photographers, etc. Watch an [acani demo video](/videos/acani-demo-2011-03-20.mov) of what we've developed thus far.

## Motivation

I believe we can make the best, most cutting-edge application for meeting people nearby with similar interests.

- Facebook is great for keeping in touch with friends, but it's not for meeting new people.
- Meetup is cool for groups, but it's not for one-to-one get togethers.
- Craigslist works for finding apartments & strippers, but it's sketchy & old-school.
- Grindr is really cool for gay guys, but what about everyone else?

## Technologies

<dl>
  <dt>iOS app</dt>

## Features

Here are a few pending features we'll implement together:

- user registers through Facebook Connect
- user uploads a profile picture
- get & update iPhone's location asynchronously in the background

## Goal

To complete version 1 of the app and submit it to the App Store by the end of the summer (Thursday, September 1, 2011). Version 1 will include the least amount of features possible that constitute a workable & presentable private beta.

## Criteria

I'm seeking an amazing, genius, diligent individual who meets the following criteria:

- Passionate about developing an application that revolutionizes society.
- Able & willing to work 10+ hrs/wk together in person on nights & weekends.
- Loves pair programming, BDD, design patterns, and writing clean, simple, and well-commented code.

## Logistics

I'm available nights (6:30pm onward) & weekends, during which I can meet in Manhattan or near Westport, CT.

## Contact

Please [email us](mailto:info@acani.com) if you're interested! Also, include your resume (or LinkedIn) and links to your projects and github & stackoverflow profiles if you have them.

Thanks!
