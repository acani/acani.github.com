# Acani iOS Opportunity & Summer Internship

> After three weeks of it's launch, Thefacebook had over 6,000 users. Within days, Zuckerberg realized that he was going to need help to operate and maintain Thefacebook. So, he turned to those closest at handâ€”his roommates. About a week after Thefacebook launched, Zuckerberg signed an employment contract with Dustin Moskovitz. A year later, in a talk, he told the story of Moskovitz joining this way: "One of my roommates was like, 'Hey, I'll help you!' I said, 'Dude! You can't program!' So, he went home for the weekend and bought the book *PERL for Dummies* and said, 'Now I'm ready.' I said, 'Dude, the site's not wirtten in PERL.'

\- Adapted from *The Facebook Effect* by David Kirkpatrick

Moskovitz is the kind of person I'm looking to join the Acani team, someone filled with youthful passion & confidence to make Acani the world's best platform for meeting people nearby with similar interests. Now, Moskovitz is worth over 3 billion.

**UPDATE**: On Spring Break? Want a one-week challenge (possibly to be continued)? Looking to earn your keep? Let's go! Now's your chance! I'm completely free for the next two weeks (til May 2, 2011) and am looking for bright individuals local to Westport, CT to meet up for at least 30 hours this week (and/or next if possible), i.e., for about 6 hours per day from like 10am - 5pm with a couple short breaks and a 30-minute lunch break. We'll work on Acani at the Westport Library, or Barnes & Noble, or the like.

## Opportunity

Gain valuable experience [pair programming](http://j.mp/cuq3vn) with other iOS engineers on a really *SWEET* project... all while having fun and getting paid.

By the end of just one week, you'll have the knowledge & skills to build your own iOS apps. And if you continue on, then by the end of the summer, you'll be a much more experienced iOS engineer, prepared to take on an exciting position at Acani or at any other company seeking iOS engineers. For example, because of my work on Acani, I was recently offered a position as an iOS Engineer at [Venmo][1].

You'll be able to claim to your friends, on your resume, and in interviews that you have at least one substantial app in the App Store.

<!-- ## Team

Two iOS engineers, of which you will be one, who will partner on building the app and pair most of the time.

One team leader, me, who will guide the direction of the app and work & program together with the two iOS engineers.

We'll plan out and reflect on the development of the app together on the weekends. I will also provide programming assistance to you then. You will then pair together on the weekdays to carry out the plan. I will always be available via phone or email. -->

## Commitment

Start immediately<!-- , part-time (10-20 hrs/wk) on nights & primarily weekends, --> with the opportunity to continue on to a full-time (40 hrs/wk) paid summer internship.

## Acani

[Acani](/) empowers you to meet people nearby with similar interests. It's like [Grindr](http://www.grindr.com) for everyone: skateboarders, programmers, models & photographers, etc. Watch an [Acani demo video](/videos/acani-demo-2011-03-20.mov) of what we've developed so far.

## Team Leader

I, [Matt Di Pasquale](http://www.mattdipasquale.com), graduated from Harvard, class of 2008, with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I have over seven years of experience in computer programming, over four years of experience as a web developer, and over one year of experience as a iOS engineer. I recently developed the [Lovers Facebook application](http://j.mp/mylovers), which reached over 1 million monthly active users. I have a passion for building social applications that revolutionize the productivity & effectiveness of the world by causing people to work together to be healthy, wealthy, loving, and abundant!

## Motivation

I believe we can make the best, most cutting-edge platform for meeting people nearby with similar interests.

- Facebook is great for keeping in touch with friends, but it's not for meeting new people.
- Meetup is cool for groups, but it's not for one-to-one get togethers.
- Craigslist works for finding apartments & strippers, but it's old-school & sketchy.
- Grindr is really cool for gay guys, but what about everyone else?

## Technologies

## Features

Here are a few pending features we'll be implementing together:

- user syncs her profile picture & info via Facebook Connect
- user changes her profile picture & info via the device
- update device's location asynchronously in the background

## Goal

To complete version 1 of the app and submit it to the App Store by the end of the summer (Thursday, September 1, 2011). Version 1 will include the least amount of features possible that constitutes a workable & presentable private beta. Trust me, it's a lot more work than it sounds, but I think we can do it!

## Criteria

I'm seeking <!-- two --> amazing, genius, diligent individuals who meet the following criteria:

- **Purpose**: Passionate about developing applications that revolutionize society
- **Autonomy**: Relishes working in small teams and having freedom & responsibility to build the best applications possible
- **Mastery**: Loves learning, pair programming, BDD, design patterns, and writing clean, simple, and clearly-commented code

<!-- ## Logistics

I'm completely available for the next two weeks until May 2. After that, I'll be moving to Philly and will only be available primarily on the weekends (10am - 6pm). Ideally, all three of us would work together 6 hours on Saturday & 6 hours on Sunday for a total of 12 hours. Then, during the summer internship, you would work the rest of the hours during the week with your partner. -->

## Compensation

The compensation will be a competitive hourly rate, based primarily on experience, skill, attitude and work-ethic. Bonuses will be awarded for hard work and results.

## FAQ

* I don't know the first thing about programming or iOS development. Can I still apply?

  Yes! I know they don't teach iOS development in high school or college (Or, maybe they do now?). I'm looking for those with a strong desire to (and faith & confidence in themselves that they can) learn how to build iOS apps... those who find this project interesting and love to learn new things, especially outside of the classroom. And, 
  
* How could I get started learning iOS development?

  The best way is to start with an idea for an iPhone app (How about Acani?) and to build it! Hands on experience and learning as you go are golden!

  Once you have an idea for an app that you'd like to make, [Download Xcode][2]. It's [$4.99 on the Mac App Store][6] or free if you're a member of the [iOS or Mac Developer Program][7] (each $99/year).
  
  After installing Xcode, open it and type `Option + Command + ?` and then type the class, object, or method you want to know more about and hit enter. You'll find great reference documentation and related tutorials and sample code & projects.
  
  Also, for other great keyboard shortcuts, check out this [Complete Xcode Keyboard Shortcut List][3] & the [StackOverflow question: What is your favorite Xcode keyboard shortcut?][4]. Note: A bunch of the Xcode 3 keyboard shortcuts have changed in Xcode 4. [StackOverflow][8] is the best place to ask programming questions if you can't find your answer through Google. Your question will be answered by expert iOS engineers within seconds of asking it. It's literally amazing!

  I recommend reading the books *iPhone Developer's Cookbook*, *iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide*, and *Cocoa Design Patterns*. Did you know you can find PDFs of most books for free from [library.nu][5]?
  
  I also recommend attending iPhone conferences like WWDC. I went to the Voices That Matter iPhone Developer's Conference in Seattle, WA, April 8-10, 2011. It was sweet! :)

Best!
